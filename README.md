# tinker-expo
A small navTabs prototype with a FAB button that opens a modal. A few notes:
- I've run this on my iPhone 11X and an Android Pixel 4 simulator running the latest OS, and everything checks out with minimal testing
- Feel free to not use, the only think I like about this is that it keeps the FAB with the navTabs. It's a little weird, but seems to work well

## Setup
Make sure you have the expo-cli installed
```npm install --global expo-cli```

Install any other dependencies
```npm i```
